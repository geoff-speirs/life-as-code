# Life as Code
A description of how I organise my life.

## Why have life as code?
I want to document how and why I codify various aspects of my life. I feel that codifying something allows for easier evolution and improvement, and ultimately increase my hapiness.

## Principles
### Start simple and refactor
Start with the simplest possible approach and make sure I follow the process. Only refactor when needed, but when it's time don't be lazy and refactor properly.

### Security first
Don't compromise on security. Especially don't publically share any personal or sensitive information.

## Ways of Working
1. Add and takes notes in issues. This is where notes and thoughts can go before they are formalised.
2. Document finalised information in source control.
